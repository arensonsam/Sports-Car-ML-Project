The "Car Data ML Project" is an advanced machine learning initiative designed to predict car prices using various predictors such as Horsepower, Engine Size, Torque, and 0-60 Time. This comprehensive project involves extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize data. It explores and compares multiple statistical models and machine learning algorithms, including Elastic Net, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to determine the most accurate method for price prediction. The project is implemented in R, utilizing key packages like tidyverse for data manipulation, tidymodels for modeling, and knitr for report generation, providing a robust framework for analyzing and predicting car pricing dynamics.
